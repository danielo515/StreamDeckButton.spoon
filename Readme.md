# StreamDeckButton Spoon
Control individual buttons of your StreamDeck from hammerspoon.

Contrary to the official StreamDeck integration that hammerspoon has, this allows you to control
individual buttons and keep the official elgato application running.

## Requirements

In order to communicate with the StreamDeck this Spoon requires the proxy extension
installed in your elgato app, and create the buttons using that extension.
Then put the connection credentials and proper ID into the button and use those 
in your config.
